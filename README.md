# Mnemonic Notebook

A note-keeping terminal application written in bash.  
The main objective is to keep a mnimalistic set of features while avoiding any dependencies beyond regular GNU tools available on most \*nix environments.

## Motivation

- An actual need to write quick notes but on a very restricted platform.
- Studying bash, bash completion, and bash internals. 
- Getting a better understandment of basic GNU tools.

## Devel notes

- 2020.12.20: Better to implement bats testing before continuing with changes suggested by shellcheck.

## Thanks

- Conrad Sollitt for [encrypt.sh](https://github.com/fastsitephp/fastsitephp/blob/master/scripts/shell/bash/encrypt.sh "FastSite PHP homepage") - leveraging OpenSSL encryption accross 3 platforms.
