# Mnemonic Notebook

A note-keeping terminal application written in bash.
The main objective is to keep a mnimalistic set of features while avoiding any dependencies beyond regular GNU tools available on most \*nix environments.

## Motivation

- Studying bash, bash completion, and bash internals. 
- Getting a better understandment of basic GNU tools.
- Actually writing notes and snippets.

## Thanks

- Conrad Sollitt for [encrypt.sh](https://github.com/fastsitephp/fastsitephp/blob/master/scripts/shell/bash/encrypt.sh "FastSite PHP homepage") - leveraging all encryption in OpenSSL accross 3 platforms.
